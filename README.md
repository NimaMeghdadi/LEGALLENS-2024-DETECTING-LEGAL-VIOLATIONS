# LEGALLENS-2024-DETECTING-LEGAL-VIOLATIONS

## About The Project
This project is my submission to LEGALLENS-2024-DETECTING-LEGAL-VIOLATIONS [competition](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/3052/) that is based on this [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2024.eacl-long.130/). 
This competition focus on two main tasks:
1. **NER**: Legal Named Entity Recognition (L-NER): Given possible online media text (review), determine or extract legal entities such as "violation," "violation by," "violation on," and "law."
2. **NLI**: Legal Natural Language Inference (L-NLI): Given a premise summarizing a class action complaint and a hypothesis from an online media text, determine if the relationship is entailed, contradicted, or neutral, indicating any association between the review and the complaint.

You can find more details about  the model in the directories.
